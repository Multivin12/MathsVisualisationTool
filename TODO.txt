Display appropriate message for situations like plot(y=sin(x,10),1<x<10) and plot(y=log(x),1<x<10)
Error should be sin only has one argument and log has two arguments.

Math functions don't work for negative numbers (i.e. abs(-10) doesn't work)

log(2,2,) doesn't show appropriate error message
Nor does log(2,2,2,2)
